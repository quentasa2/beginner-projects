i need to learn a few sorting algorithms that i can write out on the spot, the sorting algorithms i made up in v1 and v2 worked fine but took a while for lists above 10k items (more time than the leetcode time limit
allows for).

it might be good to do the same for searching algorithms too, maybe some other kinds of algorithms later.
